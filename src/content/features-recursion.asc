=== Recursion

Morloc supports recursive function definitions. A function may refer to itself
in its body, and the compiler will generate the appropriate code in the target
language.

The classic factorial function can be written using guards and self-reference:

[source, morloc]
----
fact :: Int -> Int
fact n
  ? n == 0 = 1
  : n * fact (n - 1)
----

Functions may also be mutually recursive. The following pair of functions
determines (rather inefficiently) whether a number is even or odd:

[source, morloc]
----
isEven :: Int -> Bool
isEven n
  ? n == 0 = True
  : isOdd (n - 1)

isOdd :: Int -> Bool
isOdd n
  ? n == 0 = False
  : isEven (n - 1)
----

[CAUTION]
====
Recursive Morloc functions are not equally well supported across all target
languages. Some backends may impose recursion depth limits or lack tail-call
optimization, which can cause stack overflows for deep recursion.

Additionally, if a recursive function calls foreign functions implemented in
different languages, each recursive step may cross a language boundary. These
cross-language calls involve data marshalling and inter-process communication, so
recursion that spans languages will be significantly slower than recursion within
a single language.
