=== Mapping general types to native types

When a function is sourced from a foreign language, Morloc needs to know how
Morloc general types map to the function's native types. This information is
encoded in language-specific type functions. For examples:

[source, morloc]
----
type R => Bool = "logical"
type Py => Bool = "bool"
type Cpp => Bool = "bool"

type R => Int32 = "integer"
type Py => Int32 = "int"
type Cpp => Int32 = "uint32_t"
----

Language-specific types are always quoted since they may contain syntax that is
illegal in the Morloc language.

A function such as an integer addition function `addInt`:

[source, morloc]
----
addInt :: Int32 -> Int32 -> Int32
----

This can be automatically mapped to a {cpp} function with the prototype `int addInt(int x, int y)`.

Containers can be similarly mapped to native types:

[source, morloc]
----
type Py => List a = "list" a
type Cpp => List a = "std::vector<$1>" a
----

The `$1` symbol is used to represent the interpolation of the first parameter
into the native type. So the Morloc type `List Int32` would translate to
`std::vector<uint32_t>` in {cpp}.
