=== Where clauses

Functions may use `where` clauses to define local bindings:

[source, morloc]
----
f x = y + b where
    y = x + 1
    b = 41.0
----

Where clauses inherit the scope of their parent and may be nested:

[source, morloc]
----
f = x where
    x = y where
        y = a + b
        a = 1.0
    b = 41.0
----
