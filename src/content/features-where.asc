=== `where` and `let` clauses

Functions may use `where` clauses to define local bindings:

[source, morloc]
----
f x = y + b where
    y = x + 1
    b = 41.0
----

Where clauses inherit the scope of their parent and may be nested:

[source, morloc]
----
f = x where
    x = y where
        y = a + b
        a = 1.0
    b = 41.0
----

`let` is the more orderly cousin of `where`. The `where` clause defines terms
that can be used anywhere in the `where` block and that may be any functional
argument.

[source, morloc]
----
f n =
  let m = n + 1
  let y = m + 2
  in (m + Y)
----

`let` also allows you to ignore the result of a computation:

[source, morloc]
----
f n =
  let _ = n + 1
  let y = m + 2
  in (5 + Y)
----

Ignoring the return data from `n+1` is completely pointless in this case, but
this ability will become crucial when we move on with computational that have
side-effects.
