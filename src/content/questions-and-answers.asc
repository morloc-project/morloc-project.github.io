=== What about object-oriented programming?

An "object" is a somewhat loaded term in the programming world. As far as
Morloc is concerned, an object is a thing that contains data and possibly
other unknown stuff, such as hidden fields and methods. All types in Morloc
have must forms that are transferable between languages. Methods do not easily
transfer; at least they cannot be written to Morloc binary. However, it is
possible to convey class-like APIs through typeclasses. Hidden fields are more
challenging since, by design, they are not accessible. So objects cannot
generally be directly represented in the Morloc ecosystem.

Objects that have a clear "plain old data" representation can be handled by
Morloc. These objects, and their component types, must have no vital hidden
data, no vital state, and no required methods. Examples of these are all the
basic Python types (`int`, `float`, `list`, `dict`, etc) and many {cpp} types such
as the standard vector and tuple types. When these objects are passed between
languages, they are reduced to their pure data.

=== Is this just a bioinformatics workflow language?

No. The Morloc paper https://www.zebulun-arendsee.com/images/morloc-paper-001.pdf[pre-released
here], is focused
on bioinformatics applications. As discussed at length in the paper, Morloc
addresses systematic flaws in the traditional approaches to building
bioinformatics workflows. Given the need, and also given my personal background,
it is a good place to start. However, Morloc can be more broadly applied to
any functional problem.

=== Why is it named after Morlocks, weren't they, like, bad?

While the Morlocks of Wellian fame are best known for their culinary
preferences, I maintain that Wells misrepresented them. And even if they were as
Wells claimed, we should remember that we are not so kind to our own
Eloi. Setting all that aside, the Morlocks worked below to maintain the machines
that simplified life above. It was for this quality that Morloc adapts their
name.

=== Wait! I have more questions!

Great, happy to chat!
