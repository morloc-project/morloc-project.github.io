=== General data types

Morloc supports standard primitives, homogenous lists, and tuples.

.Booleans

Booleans in Morloc are represented as `True` or `False` under the `Bool` type.

.Numbers

Numbers may be represented in normal format, scientific notation, or as
hexidecimal/octal/binary format:

[source, morloc]
----
-- standard notation for integers and floats
42
4.2

-- scientific notation (upper or lowercase 'e')
4.2E16
4.2e16
4.2e-8

-- hexadecimal notation (case insensitive)
0xf00d
0xDEADBEAF 

-- octal notation (upper or lowercase 'o')
0o755

-- binary notation (upper or lowercase 'b')
0b0101
----

.Strings

Morloc supports multi-line strings and string interpolation.

String interpolation uses the `#{...}` syntax. The expression inside the braces
must evaluate to a `Str`:

[source, morloc]
----
helloYou you = "hello #{you}"
----

String interpolation works with any expression that returns a string.

Multi-line strings use triple quotes. Leading indentation common to all lines is
stripped:

[source, morloc]
----
longString =
  """
  this is a long
  string
  """

-- single-quote triple-strings also work
anotherString = '''single quotes are also OK'''

-- triple-quoted strings can contain internal quotes
quoted = """you can use "internal quotes" freely"""
----

.Tuples

Tuples may be used to store a fixed number of terms of different type.

[source, morloc]
----
x = (1, True, 6.45)
----

.Records

Records are essentially named tuples. Record type definitions and
language-specific handling will be addressed later, but record data is expressed
as shown in the example below:

[source, morloc]
----
{ name = "Alice", age = 42 }
----

.Lists

Lists are used to store a variable number of terms of the same type.

[source, morloc]
----
x = [1,2,3]
----

Lists do not yet have special accessors (e.g., slicing). List operations are
performed through sourced functions such as `head`, `tail`, `take`, etc. You may
import many of these from the `root` modules.
